# Changelog

All notable changes to the STOMP Performance Scheduler will be documented in this file.

## [3.1.0] - 2025-01-17

### ðŸŽ¯ Critical Algorithm Fix: RED Day Fairness

#### Fixed
- **RED Day Fairness Issue**: Resolved critical bug where only 11 out of 12 performers received RED days
- **SEAN Assignment Problem**: Fixed specific case where SEAN and other performers were not getting mandatory RED days
- **Algorithm Logic Flaw**: Replaced flawed `assignRedDays` method with intelligent forced RED day creation

#### Enhanced
- **Smart Day Selection**: Algorithm now prefers weekdays (Tuesday-Friday) for RED day assignments
- **Forced RED Day Creation**: Creates RED days for performers without natural full days off
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes RED days evenly across different weekdays to prevent clustering
- **Weekend Avoidance**: Prevents RED day assignments on weekends when possible

#### Technical Improvements
- **Algorithm Rewrite**: Complete overhaul of RED day assignment logic in `backend/scheduler/algorithm.ts`
- **Helper Methods**: Added `isWeekend()`, `hasBackToBackDoubles()`, and `getBestDayForRedDay()` utilities
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added 11 new tests with 356 assertions to verify algorithm correctness
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved algorithm efficiency while maintaining all existing constraints

#### Results
- âœ… **Perfect Fairness**: All 12 performers now guaranteed exactly one RED day per week
- âœ… **Weekday Preference**: RED days assigned to Tuesday-Friday (no weekend RED days)
- âœ… **Load Distribution**: RED days spread across different weekdays (e.g., 5 on Tuesday, 3 on Wednesday, 2 on Thursday, 2 on Friday)
- âœ… **Constraint Preservation**: All existing scheduling constraints maintained while improving fairness

#### Files Changed
- `backend/scheduler/algorithm.ts` - Complete algorithm rewrite (143 insertions, 54 deletions)
- `backend/scheduler/algorithm.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite additions
